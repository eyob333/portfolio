                <p>
                    Hi, <strong>Winter-Nomad</strong>, a software engineer, web developer and musician based in Ethiopia.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I specialize in JavaScript, Python, C/C++, GLSL, Java and Go, and build scalable web apps using React, Three.js, Vite, and Express. 
                    My work spans responsive sites, real-time 3D, backend systems, and low-level software.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, I'm deepening my understanding of databases—focusing on data modeling, performance, and architecture. 
                    I love solving complex problems and turning ideas into efficient, high-impact solutions.
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    Outside of coding, 
                    I play lead guitar, participate in Jam sessions and contribute to innovative projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
